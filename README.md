Walk–Run Classification Project
📌 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify human activity as walking or running using time-series sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope readings). The goal is to analyze motion patterns and build a reliable activity recognition system.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains:

Accelerometer data: acceleration_x, acceleration_y, acceleration_z

Gyroscope data: gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z

Activity label: walk or run

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project performs detailed EDA, including:

Missing value analysis

Class distribution visualization

Sensor feature distribution plots

Outlier detection using boxplots

Correlation heatmap

Time-series visualization of accelerometer & gyroscope signals

🛠 Modeling
